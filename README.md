## Installing

If you are familiar with virtualenv create a new one after cloning the repo.

I am naming my env bobo:

```bash
virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python bobo
```

If you are using bash activate your env:

```bash
. bobo/bin/activate
```

Fish users just use the fish version.

```fish
. bobo/bin/activate.fish
```

After activating you get a similar prompt:

```fish
(bobo) ~/c/s/ice-cream-truck (master ‚ö°‚ò°=)
```

Installing libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Startung up the bot:

```fish
(bobo) ~/c/s/ice-cream-truck (master ‚ö°‚Üí‚ò°=) python chatbot.py
Using TensorFlow backend.
Missing config.py, no Telegram support
